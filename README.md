# User-Listing
I used React.js and CSS to develop a basic web application that retrieves user information from an API. To manage the state of the application, I utilized the useReducer hook along with useContext for global state management. Additionally, I created a custom hook to handle the data fetching process from the provided API.

The web application I built features pagination at the end, allowing users to navigate between different pages of data. It has been designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
